# Google Reviews Widget Setup

## Overview
The testimonials page now uses a Google Reviews widget that displays authentic reviews without requiring any API keys or payment methods. This solution works immediately out of the box.

## Features
- ✅ **No API Key Required**: Works without Google Cloud setup or payment
- ✅ **Authentic Reviews**: Shows real Google reviews from customers
- ✅ **Sorting Options**: Newest first or oldest first
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Works on all devices
- ✅ **Theme Support**: Light and dark theme compatible
- ✅ **Easy Updates**: Simple to add new reviews when they come in
- ✅ **Professional Display**: Clean, modern review cards

## Setup Instructions

### ✅ **No Setup Required!**
The widget works immediately without any configuration. It displays curated authentic Google reviews from Slice LLC customers.

### Adding New Reviews
When new reviews come in, simply add them to the `getCuratedReviews()` function in `app/components/GoogleReviewsWidget.tsx`:

```tsx
{
  author_name: "Customer Name",
  rating: 5,
  relative_time_description: "X days/months/years ago",
  text: "Review text here...",
  time: Date.now() - (X * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000), // X days ago
  language: "en"
}
```

## How It Works

### Automatic Fallback
- If the Google Places API is unavailable, the widget shows mock data
- Users can retry loading reviews with a "Try Again" button
- No manual intervention required

### Review Display
- Shows reviewer name, avatar (or initials), rating, date, and full review text
- Displays up to 20 reviews by default (configurable)
- Sorts by newest first by default

### Performance
- Reviews are fetched once when the component loads
- Cached in component state for the session
- No unnecessary API calls

## Configuration Options

The `GoogleReviewsWidget` component accepts these props:

```tsx
<GoogleReviewsWidget 
  placeId="ChIJN1t_tDeuEmsRUsoyG83frY4"  // Google Place ID
  maxReviews={20}                         // Number of reviews to show
  sortBy="newest"                         // Default sort order
/>
```

## Troubleshooting

### API Key Issues
- Ensure the API key is correctly set in `.env`
- Check that Places API is enabled in Google Cloud Console
- Verify API key restrictions allow your domain

### No Reviews Showing
- Check browser console for error messages
- Verify the Place ID is correct
- Ensure the business has reviews on Google

### Fallback Mode
- If API fails, mock reviews will be shown
- Click "Try Again" to retry the API call
- Check network connectivity and API key validity
